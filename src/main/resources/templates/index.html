            <h3> </br>OOP</h3>

            Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism. Most popular programming languages like Java, C++, C#, Ruby, etc. follow an object-oriented programming paradigm.

            <h4> <br>What is Object-Oriented Programming? </h4>
            <p> Object-Oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of programming in which programmers define the data type of a data structure and the type of operations that can be applied to the data structure.

                <br> </p>

            As Java being the most sought-after skill, we will talk about object-oriented programming concepts in Java. An object-based application in Java is based on declaring classes, creating objects from them and interacting between these objects. I have discussed Java Classes and Objects which is also a part of object-oriented programming concepts, in my previous blog.

            What are the four basic principles/ building blocks of OOP (object oriented programming)?
            The building blocks of object-oriented programming are Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. Let’s understand more about each of them in the following sequence:

            Inheritance
            Encapsulation
            Abstraction
            Polymorphism
            What are the benefits of Object Oriented Programming?
            Improved productivity during software development
            Improved software maintainability
            Faster development sprints
            Lower cost of development
            Higher quality software
            However, there are a few challenges associated with OOP, namely:
            Steep learning curve
            Larger program size
            Slower program execution
            Its not a one-size fits all solution
